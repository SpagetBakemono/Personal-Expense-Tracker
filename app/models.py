"""
Data model.

This encodes the design decisions from planning:

- Credit cards are modeled as accounts with type CREDIT_CARD. A purchase on
  a card is an EXPENSE transaction against that account (increases what you
  owe). Paying the card bill is a TRANSFER from a checking/cash account into
  the card account (decreases what you owe). This is what avoids double
  counting and solves the "card charges settle after the month" problem --
  see get_account_balance() in services.py for how balances are derived.

- Lumpy, foreseeable costs (like semester tuition) aren't a special case --
  they're logged as a normal expense on the date paid. The 12-month
  trailing average in get_trailing_average_expense() is what keeps a
  single lumpy cost from making one month look catastrophic; the raw
  monthly total is deliberately left alone since it's accurate.

- Reimbursements are tracked with a lightweight flag + status on the
  original expense, rather than a full receivables ledger. When money
  actually arrives, it's logged as its own INCOME transaction.
