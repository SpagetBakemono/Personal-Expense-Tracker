"""
Posts Plaid transactions straight into the ledger -- no review queue.

What stands in for a human reviewer:
- Plaid's transaction id is stored on the row (unique), so a re-sync can
  never post the same bank transaction twice.
- Before creating anything, an entry you already logged by hand (same
  account, amount and direction, within MATCH_WINDOW_DAYS) is *adopted* --
  linked to the Plaid id instead of duplicated.
- On a newly linked account's first sync, anything dated before your
  last entry for it is adopt-only: that stretch is already reconciled, so
  unmatched history is skipped rather than risk double-counting.
- A card payment seen by both checking and the card becomes one transfer.
- A pending transaction is updated in place when it posts, so edits made
  to it (category, note) survive.
- After every sync the app's balance is compared with the bank's; a
  mismatch is shown on the Dashboard and Accounts page.
